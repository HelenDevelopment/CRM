# CRM for delivery service
Developed by Helena Makarchuk

This university training project demonstrates a simple CRM application in which data is stored in the Azure SQL database and accessed through the RESTful web service (.NET Core 2.0 web API) that is hosted as the Azure App Service.

My Azure subscription is for students, so access to the database and the web API will close in April 2019.

Mobile app:
- Mobile platform requirements: Android 4.0.3 - Android 8.0

Desktop app:
- OS requirements: Windows 10

This application is my introduction to the Xamarin framework, so feel free to use the information from my profile to send a bug, issue or advice.
